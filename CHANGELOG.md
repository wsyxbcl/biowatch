# Changelog

All notable changes to Biowatch will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Media modal revamp: persistent right-side `ObservationRail` (replaces the bbox popover) with collapsed/expanded `ObservationRow` inline editor, `AddObservationMenu` (Draw / Whole-image), and `BboxLabelMinimal` species-only image label
- Reusable monochrome UI components extracted from the media editor: `SpeciesPicker`, `BehaviorSelector`, `LifeStageSelector`, `SexSelector`
- Keyboard shortcuts: `?` toggles the shortcuts panel, `Ctrl+arrow` navigates sequences, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycle observations even when the species picker is focused
- Whole-image observation creation wired from the rail menu
- Best-captures modal aligned with the media-modal chrome
- Media grid cell: timestamp overlay and slim footer for `ThumbnailCard` and `SequenceCard`, with new `formatGridTimestamp` utility and `getSpeciesCountsFromSequence` helper for ×N counts
- `getMediaMode` helper to keep the whole-image vs. bbox observation-mode invariant in one place

### Changed

- Image viewer area uses a black background; detection chrome and palette aligned across modal and gallery thumbnails
- "Mark as blank" surfaced as an inline link for whole-image observations only; Delete is the consistent path for marking media blank
- Species results float as an absolute dropdown (no more row jumping) and stay hidden until the user searches
- Shortcuts panel pinned in the rail above observations with lightened `kbd` styling; arrow glyphs replaced with text words for portability
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` relabelled "next / previous observation"; next/previous chevrons moved to the top toolbar; redundant top-bar draw button removed
- Keyboard-shortcuts info icon moved to the top toolbar next to Heart / Eye
- Files tab: long import paths truncate from the start so the filename stays visible
- Study bar: tab labels hidden below the `lg` breakpoint, with compact tabs forced while an import is running
- Deployments timeline adapts to screen width

### Fixed

- Sequence species counts use max-per-frame instead of summing across frames (bursts no longer inflate counts)
- Clicking outside the modal always closes it (no deselect-first dance); clicking empty image area deselects the current observation
- Empty-state flash suppressed in the rail during media navigation
- Auto-select scoping (only in whole-image mode), IME handling in the species picker, label fallback, and assorted dead-code cleanup from review

### Chore

- Bump `pytest` in `python-environments/common` (dependabot)

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Settings → Info tab redesigned with about blurb, last 3 release notes parsed from `CHANGELOG.md`, disk-usage breakdown (AI Models, Studies, Logs) with reveal-in-folder, support/links section, and a license summary with bundled-text modal
- `CHANGELOG.md` bundled with the packaged app so release notes are available offline

### Changed

- Create-study page restructured into tiered sources: slim recommended hero, primary slim rows, "Online datasets" section, and a collapsed "More import formats" disclosure
- AI Models table width capped on wide screens

### Fixed

- Long dataset names truncate correctly in the import slim row selects (`min-w-0` lets `flex-1` shrink below content width)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Resizable map/list split on the Deployments tab with persisted layout

### Changed

- Study settings page redesigned with a minimalistic rule-divided layout
- Edge-to-edge light blue hover style on species list rows
- Dropped sequence-grouping slider description in study settings

### Fixed

- Deployment rows cap height and truncate long names to keep the table tidy

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Species tooltip with blurb, IUCN Red List badge, Wikipedia fallback image, and Wikipedia link
- Species-info module with GBIF and Wikipedia response parsers, species-candidate pre-filter, pure synchronous resolver, and build script CLI; ships initial `data.json` covering 2054 species
- Inline IUCN Red List badge in species list rows
- "Show more" toggle on tooltip blurb (default 5 lines)
- Species hover tooltip shown whenever any image (study or Wikipedia) is available

### Changed

- Species hover migrated from Tooltip to HoverCard
- Wikipedia fallback images letterboxed on black to avoid awkward crops
- Inline IUCN badge aligned to the right of the row, left of the count

### Fixed

- HoverCard closes on scroll instead of riding with the row
- Inline IUCN badge hidden on media and activity sidebars
- Species-info build flushes progress every 25 entries and on SIGTERM; atomic `data.json` writes (temp + rename) so SIGKILL can't corrupt the file
- Species-info rejects unknown IUCN codes, maps verbose IUCN strings to codes, and hardens rate-limit handling
- Wikipedia thumbnail cache shared app-wide instead of per-study

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Common-name dictionary built from SpeciesNet, DeepFaune, and Manas label snapshots, with GBIF English-detection scorer and `extras.json` overrides
- `useCommonName` hook + `resolveCommonName` helper, used across Overview, Species Distribution, and Media tabs
- Common-name-first species row with in-study dot badge in the Media species picker
- Fuzzy species search via Fuse.js with debounced `dictionarySearch`, arrow-key navigation, and Enter-to-select
- Custom-species chip and delete mode in ObservationEditor; Enter commits custom species in zero-results state
- Per-frame bbox overlay for videos in the media modal, with `getVideoFrameDetections` IPC and bbox toggle for videos with detections
- Deployment marker clustering on the Overview map
- GBIF import progress with pre-counted CSV rows so `current/total` reflects real progress

### Changed

- Kruger demo dataset rewritten with real scientific names and `commonName` column
- GBIF dataset titles improved; unavailable datasets hidden in importer
- Species hover tooltip and best-captures carousel show common names
- Species list rows truncate long names with ellipsis
- Common-name dictionary values lowercased at build time
- Worker thread takes over sequence pagination, best-media selection, deployments activity, and SQL-aggregated species counts on Overview
- SQL fast-paths for sequence-aware weekly/daily/hourly aggregations and heatmap
- Indefinite caching for blank-media count, species distribution, best-media carousel/tooltip, and sequence-aware activity queries
- Sequence-gap slider commits on release instead of every drag tick; sequence-aware queries gated on resolved gap
- Overview map switched to lightweight deployments query
- FFmpeg ffmpeg-static now unpacked in the packaged app

### Fixed

- Cache invalidation for species/count queries on delete and import complete; sequence-aware heatmap invalidates on class edit; best-media cache gaps closed
- Heatmap routes unparseable timestamps through the null-timestamp branch
- Deployments map keyed by `deploymentID` instead of `locationID`; un-deduped and renamed `getDeployments` → `getDeploymentLocations`
- Daily activity falls back to `fullExtent` when `dateRange` is null
- Species dropdown anchored over media to prevent clipping
- Backspace/Delete no longer bubble out of the species editor
- Video class is editable and grid/filter stay in sync
- `ThumbnailBboxOverlay` skips bbox-less observations
- bbox queries select `commonName` so labels prefer it
- GBIF cache scoping tightened; lint unblocked in CI
- Create Release workflow has write permissions
