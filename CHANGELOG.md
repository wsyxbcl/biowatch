# Changelog

All notable changes to Biowatch will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.7] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- AI Models tab redesigned in Settings as a split / always-stacked view: new `ModelCard` with all download states, `MapPane` with region overlays + worldwide chip, `SpeciesPanel` with species chip and grouped variants, `CustomModelCard` slot for user models, and an intro copy explaining how to pick a model
- Region registry with colors and per-region GeoJSON; hand-traced Europe MultiPolygon (mainland + Scandinavia + British Isles, including Finland, Corsica, Sardinia) and a broadened Himalayas (Tien Shan, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, Kashmir, Ladakh); Manas region broadened
- Per-model species data files (`speciesnet`, `deepfaune`, `manas`) and `region` + `species_count` fields on `mlmodels`; SpeciesNet species list populated with 2,493 entries for search
- Map interactivity in the AI Models tab: auto-fit on region selection, full-width zoom for world view, species hovercards on the species panel
- Undo/redo for annotation edits: `UndoProvider` + `useUndo` wired through the four observation mutations (create, delete, classification, bbox), with bounded per-study stacks, bbox-pulse animation on undo/redo, and failed operations surfaced as a sonner toast
- `observations:restore` IPC and `restoreObservation` query backing the undo path; `createObservation` now accepts optional `observationID` and `eventID` for restore-with-same-id behavior; `getMediaBboxes` returns `mediaID`/`deploymentID`/`eventID`/`eventStart` for undo
- `SpeciesPicker` browse mode opens the dropdown on bbox-label click

### Changed

- Old `models.jsx` removed; `MlZoo` is now the AI Models tab
- `ModelCard` chrome toned down to match the app palette; Download/Delete moved to the top-right of the card header; Worldwide chip pinned top-right to clear zoom controls
- AI Models species search caps results at 50

### Fixed

- AI Models: species hovercard suppressed when no Wikipedia info exists; search hidden when the species list is empty; browser tooltip dropped from region chips
- Annotation undo: optimistic bbox patch held until the canonical `bboxes` prop catches up (no flicker); bboxes cache patched synchronously; queries invalidated after every undo/redo; pre-state read from the live `bboxes` array; undo stack cleared on study switch; failed undo/redo rolls back navigation and surfaces a buffer pulse; empty-fields restore rejected with a clear error; `delete_` inverse collapsed to a single IPC
- `BehaviorSelector`: nested `<button>` removed for DOM validity; mirrors external value changes when the dropdown is closed
- `EditableBbox`: keep local override until the bbox prop catches up
- Truncated duplicate `bbox-pulse` keyframes block in CSS

### Removed

- Arrow-key bbox nudge in `EditableBbox`

### Chore

- Documentation updated for the AI Models tab split-view structure, the undo system, the `observations:restore` IPC, and `observationID` reuse

## [1.8.6] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Deployments tab list revamp: compact 40px rows (lat/lon dropped from row), location-based grouping with always-expanded `SectionHeader` (click flies map to group bounds), interleaved alphabetical sort, and a per-deployment `Sparkline` (bars / line / heatmap) toggled via `SparklineToggle` with localStorage persistence
- `LocationPopover` for inline lat/lon editing on the Deployments detail pane, with a coordinate paste parser and a top-right "Place on map" affordance
- Deployments timeline hover crosshair showing the date range under the cursor, plus a floating observation-count pill anchored to the cursor for the selected row
- Activity tab: common names rendered alongside scientific names on the map, with a React hovercard
- `Vehicle` pseudo-species entry in the species filter (Library + Deployments) alongside `Blank`, with a new `VEHICLE_SENTINEL` constant + `isVehicle` helper and a `getVehicleMediaCount` query/IPC
- Mouse-wheel chevron centering on the Overview carousels (vertical-center on the image)

### Changed

- Overview tab: all sections fit at default viewport, tightened for small screens
- Scientific-name display normalized to ICZN binomial form across the UI
- Empty-species observations labeled `Blank` / `Vehicle` (instead of `—`); `getBlankMediaCount` redefined as "media without animal/vehicle observations"; gallery labels vehicle media as `Vehicle`; annotation rail labels `Vehicle` via `observationType` on `media-bboxes`
- Deployments detail pane: name editor is underline-only with auto-save on blur/Enter (check/cancel icons dropped); name column tightened from 200px to 140px to free sparkline width; row hover deepened to gray-100/200 for heatmap contrast
- `groupDeploymentsByLocation` extracted into a util; `scientific→common` map builder extracted into a shared util

### Fixed

- Sequences: deterministic dedup, `VEHICLE_SENTINEL` handling, and `EXISTS` probe for blank/vehicle classification
- Sequences: tiebreak by `fileName` instead of `filePath` for stable ordering
- `media-bboxes`: include `observationType` so the annotation rail can label vehicles correctly
- Gallery: vehicle media labeled `Vehicle` instead of `Blank`

### Performance

- `observationType` index added; blank-media query now uses a covering index
- `getBlankMediaCount` runs in the sequences worker

### Chore

- Drop redundant `observationType != 'blank'` proxy filter in queries
- Document blank/vehicle pseudo-species semantics; document new deployments components in architecture overview

## [1.8.5] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Deployments tab inline media workspace: selected deployment opens an inline `Gallery` pane below the list/map with `?deploymentID` URL state, `Esc` to close, and click-selected-row to toggle off; `sequences:get-paginated` gains an optional `deploymentID` filter
- Species filter popover on the Deployments detail pane, scoped to species present at the deployment, showing common name + scientific + count with hover card on filter rows
- Inline-edit deployment name from the detail pane header
- IUCN Red List CTA on threatened-species hover with rationale text and accent-border palette; new IUCN link-id builder script and bundled IDs for 2k+ species
- Hover card on study list rows in the sidebar showing stats, description, and contributors
- Mouse-wheel scrolling on the Overview best captures and featured species carousels
- Description sanitization for Wildlife Insights and Camtrap DP imports (strips DocBook tags via new `sanitizeDescription` helper)
- Reusable `Gallery` extracted into a shared module with `DeploymentMediaGallery` wrapper and embedded mode (no controls / outer border)

### Changed

- Overview tab revamp: KPI tiles (Deployments, Observations, Media) navigate to their tabs and are center-aligned with bottom-anchored sub details and compact formatting (e.g. 1.1k camera-days); description column fills the column height and "Show more" opens a modal with inline edit; vertical resize handle and map grows with panel height; "Cameras" tile renamed to "Deployments"; best captures and featured species cards bumped to w-56/h-40
- Overview tab max width capped at 1950px and aligned left on wide screens
- Deployments tab: list moved left of the map; subtle fade+slide animation on detail-pane open/close; thin resize handles; map matches Overview's `rounded-xl` + `shadow-md` and is capped at 500px tall; detail-pane header padding aligned with list-row padding (`px-2`); `'— media'` suffix dropped; widened vertical-handle margin
- Media modal: zoom control moved into the top toolbar
- Species filter sorts non-species entries to the bottom; common names capitalized
- Sequence grouping `eventID` included in the no-species select

### Fixed

- Overview: threatened-species popover stays open when clicking inside its hover-card tooltip; hover card skipped on best captures lacking a Wikipedia image and blurb; domestic species excluded from the Featured species fallback; Span and threatened popovers portaled so panel overflow no longer clips them; IUCN legend stays aligned with the NE badge and uses a 2-col grid on narrow widths
- Media modal: "No detections" badge dropped from the copy
- Media: `ImageModal` raised above Leaflet map controls
- Deployments: selection preserved when entering place mode on the active row

### Chore

- Expand species dictionary and blurbs

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Media modal revamp: persistent right-side `ObservationRail` (replaces the bbox popover) with collapsed/expanded `ObservationRow` inline editor, `AddObservationMenu` (Draw / Whole-image), and `BboxLabelMinimal` species-only image label
- Reusable monochrome UI components extracted from the media editor: `SpeciesPicker`, `BehaviorSelector`, `LifeStageSelector`, `SexSelector`
- Keyboard shortcuts: `?` toggles the shortcuts panel, `Ctrl+arrow` navigates sequences, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycle observations even when the species picker is focused
- Whole-image observation creation wired from the rail menu
- Best-captures modal aligned with the media-modal chrome
- Media grid cell: timestamp overlay and slim footer for `ThumbnailCard` and `SequenceCard`, with new `formatGridTimestamp` utility and `getSpeciesCountsFromSequence` helper for ×N counts
- `getMediaMode` helper to keep the whole-image vs. bbox observation-mode invariant in one place

### Changed

- Image viewer area uses a black background; detection chrome and palette aligned across modal and gallery thumbnails
- "Mark as blank" surfaced as an inline link for whole-image observations only; Delete is the consistent path for marking media blank
- Species results float as an absolute dropdown (no more row jumping) and stay hidden until the user searches
- Shortcuts panel pinned in the rail above observations with lightened `kbd` styling; arrow glyphs replaced with text words for portability
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` relabelled "next / previous observation"; next/previous chevrons moved to the top toolbar; redundant top-bar draw button removed
- Keyboard-shortcuts info icon moved to the top toolbar next to Heart / Eye
- Files tab: long import paths truncate from the start so the filename stays visible
- Study bar: tab labels hidden below the `lg` breakpoint, with compact tabs forced while an import is running
- Deployments timeline adapts to screen width

### Fixed

- Sequence species counts use max-per-frame instead of summing across frames (bursts no longer inflate counts)
- Clicking outside the modal always closes it (no deselect-first dance); clicking empty image area deselects the current observation
- Empty-state flash suppressed in the rail during media navigation
- Auto-select scoping (only in whole-image mode), IME handling in the species picker, label fallback, and assorted dead-code cleanup from review

### Chore

- Bump `pytest` in `python-environments/common` (dependabot)

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Settings → Info tab redesigned with about blurb, last 3 release notes parsed from `CHANGELOG.md`, disk-usage breakdown (AI Models, Studies, Logs) with reveal-in-folder, support/links section, and a license summary with bundled-text modal
- `CHANGELOG.md` bundled with the packaged app so release notes are available offline

### Changed

- Create-study page restructured into tiered sources: slim recommended hero, primary slim rows, "Online datasets" section, and a collapsed "More import formats" disclosure
- AI Models table width capped on wide screens

### Fixed

- Long dataset names truncate correctly in the import slim row selects (`min-w-0` lets `flex-1` shrink below content width)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Resizable map/list split on the Deployments tab with persisted layout

### Changed

- Study settings page redesigned with a minimalistic rule-divided layout
- Edge-to-edge light blue hover style on species list rows

### Added

- Species tooltip with blurb, IUCN Red List badge, Wikipedia fallback image, and Wikipedia link
- Species-info module with GBIF and Wikipedia response parsers, species-candidate pre-filter, pure synchronous resolver, and build script CLI; ships initial `data.json` covering 2054 species
- Inline IUCN Red List badge in species list rows
- "Show more" toggle on tooltip blurb (default 5 lines)
- Species hover tooltip shown whenever any image (study or Wikipedia) is available

### Changed

- Species hover migrated from Tooltip to HoverCard
- Wikipedia fallback images letterboxed on black to avoid awkward crops
- Inline IUCN badge aligned to the right of the row, left of the count

### Fixed

- HoverCard closes on scroll instead of riding with the row
- Inline IUCN badge hidden on media and activity sidebars
- Species-info build flushes progress every 25 entries and on SIGTERM; atomic `data.json` writes (temp + rename) so SIGKILL can't corrupt the file
- Species-info rejects unknown IUCN codes, maps verbose IUCN strings to codes, and hardens rate-limit handling
- Wikipedia thumbnail cache shared app-wide instead of per-study

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Common-name dictionary built from SpeciesNet, DeepFaune, and Manas label snapshots, with GBIF English-detection scorer and `extras.json` overrides
- `useCommonName` hook + `resolveCommonName` helper, used across Overview, Species Distribution, and Media tabs
- Common-name-first species row with in-study dot badge in the Media species picker
- Fuzzy species search via Fuse.js with debounced `dictionarySearch`, arrow-key navigation, and Enter-to-select

- Per-frame bbox overlay for videos in the media modal, with `getVideoFrameDetections` IPC and bbox toggle for videos with detections
- Deployment marker clustering on the Overview map
- GBIF import progress with pre-counted CSV rows so `current/total` reflects real progress

### Changed

- Kruger demo dataset rewritten with real scientific names and `commonName` column
- GBIF dataset titles improved; unavailable datasets hidden in importer
- Species hover tooltip and best-captures carousel show common names
- Species list rows truncate long names with ellipsis
- Common-name dictionary values lowercased at build time
- Worker thread takes over sequence pagination, best-media selection, deployments activity, and SQL-aggregated species counts on Overview
- SQL fast-paths for sequence-aware weekly/daily/hourly aggregations and heatmap
- Indefinite caching for blank-media count, species distribution, best-media carousel/tooltip, and sequence-aware activity queries
- Sequence-gap slider commits on release instead of every drag tick; sequence-aware queries gated on resolved gap
- Overview map switched to lightweight deployments query
- FFmpeg ffmpeg-static now unpacked in the packaged app

### Fixed

- Cache invalidation for species/count queries on delete and import complete; sequence-aware heatmap invalidates on class edit; best-media cache gaps closed
- Heatmap routes unparseable timestamps through the null-timestamp branch
- Deployments map keyed by `deploymentID` instead of `locationID`; un-deduped and renamed `getDeployments` → `getDeploymentLocations`
- Daily activity falls back to `fullExtent` when `dateRange` is null
- Species dropdown anchored over media to prevent clipping
- Backspace/Delete no longer bubble out of the species editor
- Video class is editable and grid/filter stay in sync
- `ThumbnailBboxOverlay` skips bbox-less observations
- bbox queries select `commonName` so labels prefer it
- GBIF cache scoping tightened; lint unblocked in CI
- Create Release workflow has write permissions
